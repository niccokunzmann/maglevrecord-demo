maglevrecord-demo
=================

A demo application for maglev record.

Open 4 command line windows (terminals) in the [project](project) directory, 3 to see the changes and 1 to do changes.

First window to track the file system:

    make watch_files
    
output:

    ./migrations [error opening dir]
    ./app/models

It uses tree to show the models and migrations of the project folder.
    
Second window to see which migrations shall be done:

    make watch_migrations
   
output:

    Already applied all migrations.
    
This calls `bundle exec rake migrate:up?` to show which migrations have to be applied

The third window trackes the changes in your stone, your database.

    make watch_changes
    
The output should be:

    rake migrate:up has to be done first
    
It calls `bundle exec rake migrate:auto?` to show what changes would be written to an automigration generated by `bundle exec rake migrate:auto`.
